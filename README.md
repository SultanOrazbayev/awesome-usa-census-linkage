Collection of links to various efforts to link full count historical USA census data.

# Links

The table below lists some of the publicly available links across complete count US census waves as provided by [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/complete_count.shtml). Typically the data consists  [`HISTID` identifiers](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/HISTID#description_section) and a selection of individual-specific information, however for full set of variables individuals may need to download it separately from the [IPUMS website](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/doc.shtml).
